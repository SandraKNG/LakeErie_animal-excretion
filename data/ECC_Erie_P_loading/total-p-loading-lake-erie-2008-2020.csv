"Note: Values are rounded to the nearest whole number. Totals may not add up due to rounding. Basin total values include loadings from runoff and tributaries in Canada and the United States, flows from Lake Huron and atmospheric sources of phosphorus. Half of the total phosphorus loadings from atmospheric sources and half of those from Lake Huron were allocated to each country.",,,
