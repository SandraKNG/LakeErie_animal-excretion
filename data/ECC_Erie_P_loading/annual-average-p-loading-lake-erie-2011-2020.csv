"Note: Values are rounded to the nearest whole number. Totals may not add up due to rounding. Point source includes municipal sewage treatment plant effluent and industrial effluent. Non-point source includes agriculture and urban storm water runoff. Atmospheric deposition refers to phosphorus being deposited directly to the lake. The Huron-Erie corridor watershed includes input from Lake Huron, non-point sources and atmospheric deposition within the watershed.",,
